# vehicle_detection_yolov5s_cv2

The primary objective of the project is to leverage YOLO v5, to develop a real-time vehicle detection and counting system for video analytics applications. This system aims in identifying and tracking cars in a video stream, differentiate between their movement directions, take the count of cars moving in different directions and provide valuable insights for traffic management, surveillance and related domains. A 30-minute traffic video was used to test the suggested system, and the findings revealed that it performs well with more accuracy.
